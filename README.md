Style and Tone Matching: Analyze existing videos to learn the creator's unique style, tone, and vocabulary. Audience-Driven Suggestions: Consider target audience demographics, interests, and preferences in script generation. Interactive Scripting: Allow creators to provide input, iterate on drafts, and refine the script with LLM assistance.
